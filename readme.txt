A plugin for developers to Extend WordPress upload to be able to use it at any place.

== Description ==

I had a problem that most of the time I had to upload a file, and I had to use a HTML upload, and that's kind of bad, so I created something to use the Thickbox and the WordPress Uploader.


If you want you can check the plugin on GitHub, I will update there then I will commmit here.
